### Hi there 👋🏻

I'm currently a Master's student in Library and Information Science at Drexel University 👩🏻‍💻

- [The Data Topic](https://github.com/topics/data) seems like it should contain datasets from the topic description. But scrolling through the tagged repositories it doesn't seem like many repositories follow this definition. 
- [The R Topic](https://github.com/topics/r) seems to have many relevant packages to R statistical software, but it is difficult to sort through repositories under the topic.
